### 📘 Project Summary
This project analyzes global AI job postings to understand how experience level, education, and company location affect salary outcomes.  
Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, the analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, and a multiple linear regression model to identify the most influential factors driving salary differences across regions.  
The findings highlight experience and location as the strongest predictors of pay, with education playing a smaller but consistent role.  
All data, code, and results are provided to ensure full transparency and reproducibility.
