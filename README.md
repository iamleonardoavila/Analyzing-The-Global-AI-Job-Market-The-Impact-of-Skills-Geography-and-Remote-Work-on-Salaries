## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes the global Artificial Intelligence (AI) job market to understand how factors such as skills, experience level, job title, company location, remote work ratio, and industry relate to salary levels worldwide.

The analysis includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Unified Sklearn/Statsmodels preprocessing pipeline  
- VIF multicollinearity analysis  
- Linear Regression (Raw & Log-Transformed)  
- XGBoost regression benchmarking  
- Cross-validation and error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R²)  
- Regression diagnostics (residual plots, Q-Q plots, histograms)
